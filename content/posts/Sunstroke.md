This is a brief trip report from last weekend's trip to Canberra. I cannot believe this crag isn't on more people's radars and so let this be an ode to Booroomba Rocks. Be forewarned there was no epic nor even any real drama. Maybe the lesson is that sometimes climbing is mostly delightful.\

We left Friday afternoon \
