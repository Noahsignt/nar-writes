I tend to go on good trips when Sam is involved. The first time we went away is still one of my favourite from the canon. It was the 2023 Easter long weekend and we had been talking about going on an overnighter together for ages. I was pretty keen on taking a revenge tour through the Budawangs after a miserable, rain-sodden weekend earlier in the year. In my opinion, the 50km round trip from Wog Wog Campground to the Castle is one of the great Australian walks. It includes the hugely brilliant Corang Arch, Corang Peak with endless views to coast and the ocean, navigating the aptly named Monolith Valley and a final, triumphant scramble up the Castle proper. With a brochure like that, it was difficult for Sam and I to lend too much weight to the forecasts. We planned on heading up on the Friday and crushing as much as we could from the late morning and into the night if need be. See below for an image of the expected conditions that night.

Honestly, it was easy enough to convince ourselves that the forecasts were overblown as we crushed some distance out from Wog Wog. Darkening skies did little to dampen the spirits as we were treated to expansive views of the South Coast alpine. When the rain started we were looking at about another 10km to guaranteed shelter in the caves of Mt. Cole. We found a protected out-crop to eat some processed meat and for Sam to don a beautiful pink poncho. He dropped his cheese but addressed it by rubbing it along his leg hairs - licking and spitting as he went. Oh Sam.

The fun dwindled massively after that. We scrambled down from the refuge, both of us mildly hypothermic, before crossing an ankle deep river occupying the space of our Plan B camp. However, it wasn't anything scary, just a bit of heavy rain and so we decided to keep pushing. By the time it was getting dark, we were looking at an easy 3km along the ridge and then a warm, dry night in the caves. What we got instead was 45 minutes of frantic hiking in the midst of some of the most deafening, head-shaking, ball-shrinking lightning I've ever been privy to. I was the tallest point for a kilometre (much taller than Sam) and actually felt that my end was imminent as every step tested divine resolve. By the time we got to the camp, we were shell-shocked and sat mute and clueless around a stranger's fire before falling asleep in the dust and out of the storm. The rest of the trip was excellent and has led to lifelong friends and countless other stories but for this story it's unimportant.

After this, I had a good 8 months free of his pestering for a trip. Who can blame him? However, as the January long weekend crept up the stoke started to build. After a few weeks of deliberation, we settled on an exploratory route from the Colo River up to the aptly named Mt. Savage by a pass described as potentially needing "rope assistance" and "for experienced workers only" in the [one source of online information](https://fatcanyoners.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Colo-River-Passes-and-Routes-Final.pdf) we could find. This ended up being an all-time sufferfest. In brief, we spent hours trying to find the pass on one of the hottest days of the year, I passed out on the banks of the river from heat stroke and we failed to make it to the peak.

All of this to say that it's a lot of fun fucking around with Sam and for the first time this weekend, on bikes! The trip was very much an impulsive decision. The long weekend and a desire to reunite meant we were both pretty stoked for some camping somewhere. I have been at negative stoke for hiking since a big trip to New Zealand over January and so the brain was working overdrive to find alternatives. When I saw a picture of a few friends with milk crates full of camping gear attached to cheap bikes, it was a clear sign. \

One of the best things about the man is how quickly he says yes to things. There's no painful analysis or detailed back-and-forth, it's a laugh and then "What should I buy?". Just 2 days later and he had roped his brother in, sourced a bucket of bolts from his uncle and ordered an unethical Amazon rear rack for milk crate mounting. By Friday morning, a few hours to departure, we had a plan. At a glance it was Ourimbah onto the old Great North Road Friday night before a cruisey day through to Wiseman's Ferry and then the long Sackville slog through to beautiful Riverstone. But you'll learn quickly that plans hold little power in the face of the whims and fancies of Sam and Jeremy Harvey.

The photo above shows our eclectic collection of mobile homes. The beast in the back is Sam's. She was fierce and temperamental, and we would spend more than a few moments keeping her happy and moving. In front of it is Jez's mule, laden with 5 days of food, 5L of water and 5g of Snus. If you look closely, you'll notice the disparity in tire width when compared to the rest of the bikes. This will be important later. Finally, with a milk crate stolen from Norton St that morning tied in by a core-shot segment of old climbing rope, is my pride and joy. Jez broke out 3 different coloured durags for no clear reason and after donning them, we made quite a sight that afternoon on the Central Coast line.
